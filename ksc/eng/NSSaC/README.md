# Nurion System Specifications and Configuration

## **A. Overview**

Nurion, which is KISTI's 5th supercomputer, is a Linux-based massively parallel cluster system that exhibits a total theoretical operation performance (Rpeak) of 25.7 PFlops (approximately 70 times that of the 4th supercomputer, Tachyon2).

&#x20;

Nurion consists of 8,305 manycore CPUs (consisting of 68 cores) that have a performance of 3 TFlops (1/100 of the overall performance of Tachyon2, the 4th supercomputer) per socket (CPU) and is consequently a cluster-based supercomputing system in which tens of thousands of cores can be utilized simultaneously. It is also equipped with high-performance interconnect, mass storage, and a burst buffer. A burst buffer can efficiently process the massive I/O requests that occur instantly in application programs.

&#x20;

Nurion aims to help improve national R\&D competence based on its large-scale computational capability and to solve complicated problems such as weather prediction or new material development as well as expensive and dangerous experiments involving aviation or new drug development. In an effort to solve different problems related to scientific technology, difficult problems are being discovered across a variety of fields even in the planning phase.

&#x20;

Various types of software are equipped and consistently upgraded in Nurion to support R\&D efforts, while high-performance hardware are linked to maintain the highest productivity. Furthermore, Nurion intends to become essential infrastructure for implementing an intelligent information society and advancing national scientific technology through user support such as through optimization, parallelization, and large project discovery for solving significant challenges.
